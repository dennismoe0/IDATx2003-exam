Designing a Modular and Maintainable Board Game in Java
In designing Ladders Game Extreme, I have applied core software engineering principles such as coupling and cohesion, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), and modular design to ensure a structured and maintainable codebase.

High Cohesion and Low Coupling
I have kept each class focused on a single purpose, ensuring high cohesion within components. For example:

GameSession manages the game logic, player turns, and movement, without handling UI concerns.
BoardView is responsible for rendering the board and handling animations but does not manage game state.
SpecialTileManager encapsulates logic for ladders and snakes, keeping special tile behaviors separate from the board model.
By separating concerns this way, I minimize coupling, making it easier to modify or extend specific parts of the game without affecting unrelated components.

Applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class adheres to SRP by handling only one responsibility:

PlayingPiece only tracks player position and color.
BoardModel defines the board structure but does not handle UI or game logic.
GameSession only enforces game rules, while BoardView solely manages visuals.
This separation improves code readability, reusability, and testability.

Extensibility and Maintainability
I designed the game to be highly modular, making it easy to:

Add new features (e.g., different board sizes or new tile types).
Modify behaviors (e.g., changing movement logic without breaking UI code).
Ensure scalability, allowing more players, additional animations, or new game mechanics.
