Any assets or database files should be here I think.

I.e. images for the board game, databases, tilesets etc.

(We should probably implement a tileset method for long ladders if we're making an arcade mode where ladder can be superlong like Sasha suggested)
(I.e. we would store all ladder/snake assets here)
