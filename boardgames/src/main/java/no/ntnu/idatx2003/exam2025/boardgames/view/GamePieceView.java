  // -> Update gamepiece with observable ID for it's current tile position that is
  // used for movement.
  // GamePieces should be able to be on the same tile (rezising), and should be
  // connected visually to the tile their on
  // I.e. if a piece from player 1 is on tile 4, it should be shown there on top
  // of BoardView's view of the board.
  // Since BoardView is a part of BoardGameView this should be a part of that.
  // Summary: Visual pieces based on backend location.
