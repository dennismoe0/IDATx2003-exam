Need to make the board size/tile sizes resize based on the size of the window

Need to add menus/clear logging
-> Which player's turn it is
-> What they rolled etc

Ladders need to be shown

Player turn doesnt work based on age even though I added a method

If a player gets 6, set the player turn index back one point to make them get another turn
-> Add message "You rolled a 6, you can throw again!"


Using CHATGPT to make laders and snakes, nvrm didnt work it sucks ass
