DAO files for interacting with a database.


PlayerDAO can be reused.


Im going to create player objects that a user can create and then wins, losses and winrate etc can be stored there
as a database implementation for extra points.

Statistics:
-Wins, losses, moves, tiles moved, total games, event spaces etc
