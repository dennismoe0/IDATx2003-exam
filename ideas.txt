Ladder games:

Randomized boards/ladders

"four types"-

-> Standard Classic
  -> Classic Ladder Game experience.

-> Randomized Classic
  -> Ladders etc are randomized so the same board isnt played each time.

-> Standard Arcade
  -> Implement cards, board functions (rotate 90 degrees i.e.), event spaces
    -> Event spaces:
       -> Flip board, rotate board, , everyone falls down one line?, 
          everyone goes up one line (cant win with this)

-> Randomized Arcade:
  -> Random map with all functions of Standard Arcade.
   -> Move ladders (randomly or maybe 1 manually?)

Cards:
-> Pick up cards with abilities (balatro Joker i.e.)
   -> Reroll, curse someone (max roll of 3 ie.), roll twice, roll twice pick highest,
      skip a turn / chosen player skips, 


Ladder rotate/move:
 -> Entry point & exit point. Texture between

 Jokers:
 -> balatro inspired.
 -> Would need a bigger board/endless/death mode.
     -> Death mode: You die after not moving enough/getting enough of something (single player mode).
          -> Different stages: Lvl 1 = get to space 20, lvl 2 = 50, lvl 3 = 100 etc.

- Need a nice function for calculating huge moves at a time. I.e. 54 moves.
  -> If we use a row and tile system (i.e. row 3 tile 4) it needs to be able to find the correct row and tile.
  -> In standard this is easy because each dice throw is a max of 6, but in arcade it could be different. 

Database: Only needed for high scores and potentially player ID's connected to these high scores.
